## Prompt
```
A photorealistic concept art scene called *"The Foundry in Action"*.

**Setting:**
The scene is a collaborative workshop inside a modern open-air farm shed in the New England region of Australia. In the background, golden-hour light falls across rolling hills, conveying optimism and a strong sense of place.  

**Characters (The Triple-Threat Team):**
1. **The Regional Business Leader (Problem Owner):** A pragmatic farmer or local business owner in their 40s–50s, wearing a work shirt and Akubra hat. They are pointing decisively at a real-world object such as a water pump, soil sensor, or farm equipment, representing authentic lived knowledge.  
2. **The UNE Academic (Translator):** A sharp, engaged researcher in their 30s–40s, holding a ruggedised tablet. The tablet projects a holographic "Digital Twin" of the machinery into the air. The academic listens intently to the farmer, bridging research and practice.  
3. **Two UNE Students (Future Workforce):**  
   - One is an **Indigenous Australian student**, actively holding a sensor and connecting it to the equipment.  
   - The other is a non-branded student (no UNE logo visible), interacting with the holographic interface directly.  

**Technology:**
- The holographic projection is semi-transparent, minimalist, showing clean data visualisations, diagnostics, and solution pathways.  
- Thin, glowing lines in cool blues and cyans connect the physical equipment to its digital twin, symbolising data-driven innovation.  

**Artistic Style & Details:**
- **Style:** Photorealistic, cinematic, professional—appropriate for a national strategic plan.  
- **Lighting:** Warm golden hour, streaming into the shed, casting long soft shadows and highlighting the collaborative moment.  
- **Colour Palette:** Natural, earthy tones for the people and shed; clean, cool blues and whites for the tech overlay.  
- **Composition:** Landscape orientation (16:9). The focus is on the human interaction and genuine co-creation, making the viewer feel they are witnessing a real, collaborative breakthrough.  

**Keywords:** university-industry collaboration, mentorship, regional innovation, problem-solving, ag-tech, teamwork, Australia, entrepreneurship, hands-on learning, Indigenous student, optimism, future workforce.

## Notes
- First version including Indigenous student and no UNE branding.  
- Suitable for use in strategic reports and presentations.  
- Possible future tweak: test different machinery types (soil sensors, pumps, tractors) as the focal problem object.
